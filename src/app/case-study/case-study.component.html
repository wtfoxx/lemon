        The Flexnit App is a single-page web app developed entirely from scratch using the
        MERN stack, state routing, and a responsive UI framework for a seamless, smooth
        experience. The app provides movies from a dedicated API and allows users to create
        and edit their personal accounts, view information about the movies, Directors, and
        Genres, and add/remove movies to a list of favorites.

          Flexnit was a personal project I built as part of a web development program at
          CareerFoundry to demonstrate practical knowledge of full-stack JavaScript
          development.

        <p class="case-text">
          The aim was to build a full-stack project that I could add proudly to my professional
          portfolio. I wanted to build both the server-side and client-side for the app from
          scratch.

        <u>Server-side:</u>
        <br/>
        The first challenge was to create an API. The method I used was a RESTful API using
        Node.js and Express, allowing it to talk to a non-relational database: MongoDB. The
        API is accessed through HTTP requests like GET, POST, and DELETE, and is edited
        through CRUD methods. Itâ€™s secured by HTTP authentication with JWT passport
        authentication, bcrypt password hashing, express-validator for server-side input
        validation, and CORS data security. The API shows and receives information in JSON
        format.
